##Project Overview
For my capstone project, I built machine learning models to predict football match outcomes (home win, draw, away win) for a sports analytics consultancy. I used algorithms like multinomial logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, with features including expected goals, team market value, attacking strength, attendance, and betting odds.
The model was trained on data from 1,140 Premier League matches (2019â€“2022), and the best version achieved 64% accuracy. This project was awarded Outstanding Capstone Project and was designed to help the consultancy offer sharper, data-driven insights to football clubs and leagues.
